                        <p>White water rafting has its roots back in the 1800s, when explorers and adventurers began floating down rivers on simple wooden rafts. One of the first recorded trips happened in 1842, when Lieutenant John Fremont took on the Platte River. Back then, it wasn't about fun, it was about exploration and survival. But those early journeys were the spark that eventually lit the fire for what rafting would become. As time went on, rafting became not only a means of travel but also a recreational activity.
                        Today, it's a growing sport that mixes adventure, teamwork, and nature.

                        <p>Echo Waters started as a simple idea. My brother and I always dreamed of starting something of our own. One day, we saw a flyer for a summer camp and decided to go. That weekend was unforgettable, and that's when the idea of white water rafting clicked.
                        At first, it was just us and a few friends. Then more people started showing up. We didn't have much money to grow big, but we had the drive. Despite competition, what made us different was the sense of family we gave to people. That spark turned us into what we are today.
