            <p>
            My name is Sebastian. I'm from Mexico. Since I was a kid, I've loved music, especially jazz and classical. I play the piano, saxophone, and guitar.
            I go to church every sunday, i am an elementary school teacher at the church and i really like teaching the kids and learning from them.
            I love playing video games with my friends and family, as well as board games, and of course, I really enjoy programming, since i was a kid programming seemed incredible to me, because of my interest i took some courses and started learning basic things, mainly in Unity, thats when i decided that this is what i wanted to study.
            I'm very excited to learn more about web development, and I have high hopes for this course!
