            <p>My name is Sebastian. I'm from Mexico. Since I was a kid, I've loved music, especially jazz and classical. I play the piano, saxophone, and guitar.
            I love playing video games with my friends and family, as well as board games, and of course, I really enjoy programming!
            I'm very excited to learn more about web development, and I have high hopes for this course!
